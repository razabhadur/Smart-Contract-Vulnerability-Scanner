# Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner

The Smart Contract Vulnerability Scanner is a tool designed to perform static analysis on Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. It detects common vulnerabilities and provides feedback to developers.

## Features

- **Reentrancy Attack Detection**: Identifies potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.
- **Unchecked Send Detection**: Checks for unchecked send methods.
- **Timestamp Dependency Detection**: Detects reliance on `block.timestamp`.
- **Gas Limit Dependency Detection**: Identifies functions that might be vulnerable due to gas limits.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python smart_contract_scanner.py
   ```
3. Enter your Solidity contract code when prompted.
4. Review the detected vulnerabilities.
